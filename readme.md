# Project Overview

For this project, you will assume the role of a **Data Scientist / Data Analyst** working for a new startup investment firm that helps customers invest their money in stocks. Your primary task will involve extracting financial data, such as historical share prices and quarterly revenue reports, from various sources. You will use Python libraries and web scraping techniques to collect data on popular stocks including:

- Tesla
- Amazon
- AMD
- GameStop

After gathering this data, you will visualize it in a dashboard to identify patterns and trends.

## Dashboard Analytics Displayed

A dashboard typically provides a clear visualization of key performance indicators (KPIs). In this project, you will:

- Analyze datasets to extract KPIs.
- Use prompts to learn how to access and display data effectively in dashboards.
- Gain experience in displaying KPIs on a dashboard.

**Plotly** will be used in this course for data visualization, although prior knowledge of Plotly is not required.

## Tools and Platforms

In previous coursework (*Python for Data Science, AI, and Development*), you used **Skills Network Labs** for practical hands-on experience. For this current project, you'll be utilizing:

- **Skills Network Labs**: A sandbox environment designed for completing labs and interactive learning.
- **Watson Studio**: Part of IBM Cloud Pak for Data, Watson Studio provides tools and a collaborative environment for data scientists, data analysts, AI and ML engineers, and domain experts to develop and deploy projects.

## Review Criteria

Your project will be evaluated based on:

- Completion of two hands-on labs focused on extracting stock data.
- Performance on two quizzes that test your understanding based on lab outputs.
- A peer review assignment where you will share screenshots demonstrating the outcomes of your work.
